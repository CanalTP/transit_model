# Reading NTFS fares
## Introduction
This document describes how [NTFS fares](https://github.com/CanalTP/navitia/blob/dev/documentation/ntfs/ntfs_fare_extension_fr.md) are loaded in Navitia Transit Model.

In this initial version: 
- only tickets on origin-destination stops are taken into account
- only transitions based on physical modes are taken into account, all other constraints are ignored (e.g validity duration, number of transfers allowed, constraints on networks/lines) 
- tickets specified in a currency different than EUR are ignored
- only tickets on origin-destination stops are taken into account.

These limitations will be covered in later version, following the updates of the NTM fares model.

In the following, the NTM properties that are not specified are ignored and not detailed.
