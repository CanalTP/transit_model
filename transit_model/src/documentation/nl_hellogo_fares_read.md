# HelloGo fares reading specification
## Introduction
This document describes how fares provided by Keolis Netherlands are read in Navitia Transit Model (NTM).

## Input data description
The fare data expected at the input of the connector comes in the form of XML files based on [Netex fare exchange format](http://www.normes-donnees-tc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/BNTRA-CN03-GT7_N0064_prCEN_TS_278330_FV_E-part_3-v9-1.pdf). Each file is composed of 3 basic elements:
- a *ResourceFrame* specifying the data owner and the validity period of the provided data
- a *ServiceFrame* specifying the network, the lines and the stops to which the fare structure is applied
- one or more *FareFrame*s specifying the fare structures and the underlying conditions.

The supported fare structures depend on origin-destination (OD) stop pairs in two ways:
- the ticket price between an origin and a destination is directly specified (*DirectPriceMatrix*)
- the price for a fare distance unit is specified, as well as the fare distance between an origin and a destination (*UnitPrice* & *DirectMatrix*). The ticket price between the origin and destination stops is computed by multiplying the fare distance by the fare distance unit. In this case, one and only one frame of type *UnitPrice* is expected: if none or more than two are provided, the file is considered invalid and should be discarded.

## Connector description
Each *FareFrame* specified in the input fare data corresponds to several `Tickets` in NTM (as many as the elements of the *DistanceMatrix* and *DirectPriceMatrix*). For each *DistanceMatrixElement*, one `Ticket` object is created specifying the associated line and the origin/destination stops.

The NTM properties that are not specified in the source data are not described below.

### Ticket
NTM Property | Source frame | Source element | Notes/Mapping rule
--- | --- | --- | ---
ticket_id | *FareFrame* | *DistanceMatrixElement{id}* |
ticket_name | | | Fixed value `Ticket Origin-Destination`.

### Ticket_price
NTM Property | Source frame | Source element | Notes/Mapping rule
--- | --- | --- | ---
ticket_id | | | Id of the `Ticket` to which this `Ticket_price` is applied.
ticket_price | | | See the mapping rule below.
ticket_currency | *FareFrame* | *FrameDefaults/DefaultCurrency* |
ticket_validity_start | *ResourceFrame* | *versions/Version/StartDate* |
ticket_validity_end | *ResourceFrame* | *versions/Version/EndDate* |

#### Computing the ticket price
The ticket price is calculated by adding the boarding fee to the price specified for the origin-destination pair:
- The boarding fee is equal to the value of *FareFrame/EntranceRateWrtCurrency*.
- The OD price is calculated differently based on the *FareStructure* type:
  - if the *FareStructure* type is a *DirectPriceMatrix*, the value of *DistanceMatrixElementPrice/Amount* is multiplied by the value of *DistanceMatrixElementPrice/Units*.
  - if the *FareStructure* type is a *UnitPrice*, the value of *DistanceMatrixElementPrice/Distance* is multiplied by the value of *GeographicalIntervalPrice/Amount* and then by the value of *GeographicalIntervalPrice/Units*.

If *FareFrame/RoundingWrtCurrencyRule* is specified, a rounding rule for the specified `currency_type` is applied to the computed ticket price. For example, if the value is set to `0.01` for the currency `EUR`, then the ticket price is rounded to the nearest euro cent.

If the computed ticket price exceeds the value of *FareFrame/CappingWrtCurrencyRule*, then the latter is taken into account.

### Ticket_use
NTM property | Source frame | Source element | Notes/Mapping rule
--- | --- | --- | ---
ticket_id | | | Id of the `Ticket` to which this `Ticket_use` is applied.
ticket_use_id | *FareFrame* | *DistanceMatrixElement{id}* | The id is prefixed with `TU:`.
max_transfers | | | Fixed value `0`.
boarding_time_limit | | | This field is explicitly left empty.
alighting_time_limit | | | This field is explicitly left empty.

### Ticket_use_perimeter
NTM property | Source frame | Source element | Notes/Mapping rule
--- | --- | --- | ---
ticket_use_id | | | Id of the `Ticket_use` to which this `Ticket_use_perimeter` is applied.
object_type | | | Fixed value `line`.
object_id | *FareFrame* | *TriggerObjectRef{ref}* | This value references the associated line in the *ServiceFrame*, for a *TriggerObjectRef{nameOfRefClass}* matching the value `Line`.  See the mapping rule below.
perimeter_action | | | Fixed value `1`.

### Setting the object_id in the Ticket Use Perimeter
Finding the line in the NTFS to which a fare is applied is not straightforward.

The *TriggerObjectRef{ref}* whose value of *nameOfRefClass* equals to `Line` indicates the line used in a *DistanceMatrix* (and therefore associated with all the enclosed elements). This line points to a *Line* in the *ServiceFrame* with a *KeyValue* element. The *object_id* references the *line_id* found in the NTFS (ignoring the NTFS applied prefix) that matches the *Value* of the *Key* equal to `KV1PlanningLijnNummer`.

### Ticket_use_restriction
NTM property | Source frame | Source element | Notes/Mapping rule
--- | --- | --- | ---
ticket_use_id | | | Id of the `Ticket_use` to which this `Ticket_use_restriction` is applied.
restriction_type | | | Fixed value `OD`.
use_origin | *FareFrame* | *DistanceMatrixElement/StartStopPointRef{ref}* | This field points to a stop_area found in the NTFS. See the mapping rule below.
use_destination | *FareFrame* | *DistanceMatrixElement/EndStopPointRef{ref}* | This field points to a stop_area found in the NTFS. See the mapping rule below.

#### Setting the use_origin and use_destination in the Ticket Use Restriction
Finding the right stops in the NTFS to which a fare is applied is not straightforward. 

The stops in the *FareFrame* point to the *ScheduledStopPoint*s in the *ServiceFrame*. The *ScheduledStopPoint*s are composed of *PointProjection*s that are referenced in the NTFS as stop_points.

The *use_origin* refers to the stop_area found in the NTFS that has an associated stop_point whose *stop_id* (ignoring the NTFS applied prefix) matches the value of *ProjectedPointRef{ref}* (without the network prefix, if any) of the *ScheduledStopPoint* in the *ServiceFrame* having the *id* referenced by *StartStopPointRef{ref}* in the *DistanceMatrixElement*. 

The *use_destination* refers to the stop_area found in the NTFS that has an associated stop_point whose *stop_id* (ignoring the NTFS applied prefix) matches the value of *ProjectedPointRef{ref}* (without the network prefix, if any) of the *ScheduledStopPoint* in the *ServiceFrame* having the *id* referenced by *EndStopPointRef{ref}* in the *DistanceMatrixElement*.

If multiple *ProjectedPointRef{ref}* are found for *use_origin*, one Ticket Use Restriction will be created for each possible combination of *use_origin* and *use_destination*. Same applies if multiple *ProjectedPointRef{ref}* are found for *use_destination* (all possible combinations).

If no matching is found for the origin or the destination stop, then the stop is ignored and the corresponding `Ticket` is discarded.
