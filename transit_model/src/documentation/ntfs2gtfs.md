# NTFS to GTFS conversion
## Introduction
This document describes how a [NTFS feed](https://github.com/CanalTP/navitia/blob/dev/documentation/ntfs/) is transformed into a [GTFS feed ](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/) in Navitia Transit Model.

The resulting GTFS feed is composed of the following objects:
- [agency](#agencytxt)
- [routes](#routestxt)
- [stops](#stopstxt)
- [trips](#tripstxt)
- [stop_times](#stop_timestxt)
- [calendar_dates](#calendar_datestxt): only this file is provided instead of the calendar.txt file.

The following additional files are generated only if the corresponding objects are present in the NTFS.
- [transfers](#transferstxt)
- [shapes](#shapestxt)
- [stop_extensions](#stop_extensionstxt): additional information providing the complementary stop codes used in external systems.

## Mapping between NTFS and GTFS objects
#### agency.txt

GTFS field | Required | NTFS file | NTFS field | Note
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
agency_id | yes | networks.txt | network_id |
agency_name | yes | networks.txt | network_name |
agency_url | yes | networks.txt | network_url | `http://www.navitia.io/` if the value is not provided.
agency_timezone | yes | networks.txt | network_timezone | `Europe/Paris` if the value is not provided.
agency_lang | no | networks.txt | network_lang |
agency_phone | no | networks.txt | network_phone |

#### routes.txt
Each line of this file corresponds to a transit line modeled in the NTFS feed. In case a transit line uses more than one modes of transportation, it should be modeled separately for each different mode, according to the mapping of modes presented below. The priorities follow the [NeTex Specification](http://www.normes-donnees-tc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/NF_Profil_NeTEx_pour_les_arrets-_F-_-_v2.pdf) (cf. chapter 6.2.3).

GTFS field | Required | NTFS file | NTFS field | Note
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
route_id | yes | lines.txt | line_id | See below for lines containing trips with different modes
agency_id | no | lines.txt | network_id | (link to the [agency.txt](#agencytxt) file)
route_short_name | yes | lines.txt | line_code | empty string "" if the value is not provided
route_long_name | yes | lines.txt | line_name |
route_type | yes | | | The corresponding physical mode of the trips of the line. See the table below for the mapping of modes.
route_color | no | lines.txt | line_color |
route_text_color | no | lines.txt | line_text_color |
route_sort_order | no | lines.txt | line_sort_order |

**Mapping of `route_type` with physical modes**

physical_mode_id in the NTFS | route_type in the GTFS | Priority w.r.t. NeTex | Absolute order
--- | --- | --- | ---
Tramway | 0 | 5 | 1
RailShuttle | 0 | 3 | 2
Metro | 1 | 4 | 3
LocalTrain | 2 | 3 | 4
LongDistanceTrain | 2 | 3 | 5
RapidTransit | 2 | 3 | 6
Train | 2 | 3 | 7
BusRapidTransit | 3 | 7 | 8
Bus | 3 | 7 | 9
Coach | 3 | 7 | 10
Boat | 4 | 2 | 11
Ferry | 4 | 2 | 12
Funicular | 7 | 6 | 13
Shuttle | 7 | 6 | 14
SuspendedCableCar | 6 | 7 | 15

The physical_modes Air and Taxi are not available in standard GTFS `route_type`s and should be considered as unknown for the GTFS (see below).
If the physical_mode is unknown, trips should be considered as Bus (route_type = 3) and with a priority of 16 .

**Export of NTFS lines containing trips with different modes**
A GTFS `route` can only contains trips with one mode (ie. `route_type`).
If a NTFS `line` contains `trip`s that should be associated with different gtfs `route_type`s, 2 different GTFS `route`s must be generated :
- The trips using the physical mode with the lowest priority are modeled by a GTFS `route` with the field `route_id` matching the value of the NTFS `line_id`.
- The trips using other physical modes are modeled by a separate GTFS `route` for each corresponding `route_type`, adding the suffix ":<physical_mode_id>" to the value of `route_id` and assigning the corresponding physical mode to the field `route_type`.



### stops.txt
Stops and stations (stops having `location_type` = 0 and 1) are the only objects handled in the current version.

GTFS field | Required | NTFS file | NTFS field | Note
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
stop_id | yes | stops.txt | stop_id
stop_name | yes | stops.txt | stop_name
stop_lat | yes | stops.txt | stop_lat
stop_lon | yes | stops.txt | stop_lon
zone_id | no | stops.txt | fare_zone_id
location_type | no | stops.txt | location_type
parent_station | no | stops.txt | parent_station
timezone | no | stops.txt | timezone
stop_desc | no | comments.txt, comment_links.txt | comment_name | The value of `comment_name` referenced by the `comment_id` having an `object_type` = `stop_point` or `object_type` = `stop_area` and an `object_id` equal to the corresponding `stop_id`. In case of more than one comments linked to the same trip, the first comment in alphabetical order is taken into account.

### trips.txt

GTFS field | Required | NTFS file | NTFS field | Note
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
route_id | yes | trips.txt | route_id |
service_id | yes | trips.txt | service_id |
trip_id | yes | trips.txt | trip_id |
trip_headsign | no | trips.txt | | (1)
trip_short_name | no | trips.txt | | (1)
direction_id | no | routes.txt | direction_type | `0` if the corresponding value is `forward`, `clockwise` or `inbound`. `1` otherwise.
block_id | no | trips.txt | block_id |
shape_id | no | trips.txt | geometry_id | (link to the [shapes.txt](#shapestxt) file)
wheelchair_accessible | no | trip_properties.txt | wheelchair_accessible | The value of `wheelchair_accessible` referenced by the `trip_property_id` of this trip.
bikes_allowed | no | trip_properties.txt | bike_accepted | The value of `bike_accepted` referenced by the `trip_property_id` of this trip.

(1) If the value of the `physical_mode_id` for this trip is `LocalTrain`, `LongDistanceTrain`, `Metro`, `RapidTransit` or `Train`,
- the field `trip_short_name` takes after the value of the `trip_headsign` field in the NTFS
- the field `trip_headsign` contains the value of the `stop_name` linked to the stop_point of this trip with the higher order in the trip (i.e. the name of the last stop of the trip).

Otherwise,
- the field `trip_short_name` is empty
- the field `trip_headsign` contains
  - the value of the `trip_headsign` field in the NTFS, if present
  - otherwise, the value of the `stop_name` linked to the stop_point of this trip with the higher order in the trip (i.e. the name of the last stop of the trip).
